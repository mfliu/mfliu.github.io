I'm Monica Liu, currently a Data Engineer at Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research. My main interests are in biology and computer science, and the technologies we can develop that combine these fields. More specifically, I'm interested in how the approaches we use in computer science can be applied to give us greater control over cellular functions, or how they can inform our design and development of medical devices and robots. 

This site is mainly my (hardly ever updated) blog and also serves as a photodump from my more scenic wanderings. If for some reason you would like to contact me, you can do so in the following ways:
